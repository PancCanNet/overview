# PancCanNet Project
<img src="logo.png" alt="logo" width="150" align="right"/>

The aim of this project is the creation of a **biological pathway community portal** (PancCanNet) as a unified knowledge base for pancreatic cancer. The portal enables expert clinical researchers (medical and scientific) to add and curate pathway content and allows **programmatic access for downstream knowledge integration, data analysis, and data visualization**. PancCanNet provides a resource for determining the functional impact of multi-omics experimental data with the aim to understand the mechanisms of treatment resistance, discover novel biomarkers and develop personal treatment options for pancreatic cancer patients.

### Pathway collection

The [PancCanNet pathway portal](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Portal:PancCanNet) is maintained on the community curated pathway database [WikiPathways](https://www.wikipathways.org/). 

* **Portal**: [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Portal:PancCanNet](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Portal:PancCanNet)
* **Pathways**: xx pathways from xx contributors
* **License**: CC0
* **Availability**:
  * GPML files: [Download](http://www.wikipathways.org//wpi/batchDownload.php?species=Homo%20sapiens&fileType=gpml&tag=Curation:PancCanNet)
  * Pathway-gene network: xxx

If you are interested in joining our intiative and contribute to the pathway collection or request pathways to be added, please do not hesistate to contact us!

### Data analysis workflows

* [Analysis workflow 1](workflows/workflow1.md): Exploration of the PancCanNet pathway collection
* [Analysis workflow 2](workflows/workflow2.md): Analysing a pancreatic cancer gene expression dataset
* [Analysis workflow 3](workflows/workflow3.md): Analysing a pancreatic cancer immune panel dataset (PPI network + pathway information)
* [Analysis workflow 4](workflows/workflow4.md): Drug-target identification
* [Analysis workflow 5](workflows/workflow5.md): Network diffusion to find affected pathways

---

### Workshops

We organized two different workshops:
* Pathway curation
* [Pathway analysis](https://panccannet.github.io/workshop/) (automation in R)

---

### Team

The PancCanNet project is a collaboration between Erasmus MC Rotterdam, Maastricht University and Omnigen.
